      <h3>Why I Like It</h3>
      <p>
        The main reasons why I like this visualization are: it is very visually
        pleasing and well designed; and the subject matter is very interesting
        to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of the design, there is a lot of complexity intrinsic to this
        data which is very well-managed by the visualization. There are 5
        details that the designer is attempting to highlight which are found in
        the legend at the top of the visualization. Aside from the details, the
        main points emphasized are the path length and the quantity of trackers.
        By making the large-scale features and other details fade into the
        background through low-contrast color choices, the emphasized details
        can be easily viewed. However, the designer importantly still visualizes
        the data which is not the point of focus. This helps to emphasize the
        large-scale features.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the subject matter, there are a few points that intrigue me. First,
        it seems there is a corrolation between the type of site and the number
        of trackers. Large online publications heavily track their users with
        trackers from a variety of providers. In addition to this, the ID is
        being shared between these large sites. This, in addition to the
        potential collection of Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) is
        worrisome from a privacy standpoint. There are an incredible amount of
        trackers on the news sites and it is kind of dissapointing how
        journalism has widely been polluted by the motivation for ad revenue.
